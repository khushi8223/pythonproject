heart-disease-prediction.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook for data analysis, preprocessing, and model training.

heart.csv - Dataset used for training and testing the model.

heart_model.joblib - Trained model saved using Joblib.

scaler.joblib - Scaler object used for data normalization.

columns.joblib - Column names used in the model.

heart_model_13_features.joblib - Alternate model with 13 features.

scaler_13_features.joblib - Scaler for the 13-feature model.

🚀 Features
Data preprocessing and visualization.

Model training using Logistic Regression.

Model evaluation using accuracy score and confusion matrix.
